# HGSS Pokémon Tileset

This project contains ready-to-use tilesets for **RPG Maker XP**.  
The original tilesets were created by **SirMalo** on DeviantArt — you can find them [here](https://www.deviantart.com/sirmaio/art/HGSS-for-RMXP-837574941).

I formatted them to be compatible with RPG Maker XP by:

- Adjusting the layout to fit the 8-tile width standard.
- Rescaling the original tiles from **16x16** to **32x32**.
- Replacing the pink background with transparency.

Each folder corresponds to one of SirMalo's tilesets and contains a cleaned PNG version.

The `Fused_with_basics/` subfolder includes custom combinations I made using tiles from **Pokémon Essentials** and SirMalo’s cleaned tilesets.
